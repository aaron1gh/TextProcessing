What works well:
The program counts words correctly
Output is clear and easy to read
uses a class and methods to organize the code better than the first repo

Comments and Documentation
There are few comments. Adding explanations for methods and the main idea would help others understand faster

Error Handling
The program doesn’t check if the file exists or if it can be opened
It should add error handling to avoid crashing if the file is missing or unreadable

Variable Naming
Some variable names are okay but could be clearer about their purpose

Code Structure
Code is better organized with methods and a class
The main method still does a lot of work; moving more into the class would improve clarity

File Assumptions
Assumes the file has content and doesn’t check for empty files or empty lines

OOP Principles
Uses a class which is somewhat good
Could improve by putting more logic inside class methods

Output Formatting
Output is readable but could be better with sorted words or clearer spacing
